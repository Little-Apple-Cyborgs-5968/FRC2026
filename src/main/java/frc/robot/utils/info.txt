2026 Game Data Details

In the 2026 FIRST® Robotics Competition game, the first goal to go inactive is determined by the alliance that scores more Fuel in Auto. The field will transmit the alliance to all 6 teams using Game Data. This page details the timing and structure of the sent data and provides examples of how to access it in the three supported programming languages.
The Data
Timing

Data is sent to both alliances simultaneously after Fuel scored in Auto is finished being assessed, approximately 3 seconds after the end of Auto. Between the beginning of the match and this point, the Game Data will be an empty string.
Data format

The alliance will be provided as a single character representing the color of the alliance whose goal will go inactive first (i.e. ‘R’ = red, ‘B’ = blue). This alliance’s goal will be active in Shifts 2 and 4.
Accessing the Data

The data is accessed using the Game Data methods or VIs in each language. Below are descriptions and examples of how to access the data from each of the three languages. As the data is provided to the Robot during the Teleop period, teams will likely want to query the data in Teleop periodic code.
C++/Java/Python

In C++, Java, and Python the Game Data is accessed by using the GetGameSpecificMessage method of the DriverStation class. Teams likely want to query the data in a Teleop method such as Teleop Periodic in order to receive the data after it is sent during the match. Make sure to handle the case where the data is an empty string as this is what the data will be until the selected alliance is sent.
JAVA

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DriverStation;
String gameData;
gameData = DriverStation.getGameSpecificMessage();
if(gameData.length() > 0)
{
  switch (gameData.charAt(0))
  {
    case 'B' :
      //Blue case code
      break;
    case 'R' :
      //Red case code
      break;
    default :
      //This is corrupt data
      break;
  }
} else {
  //Code for no data received yet
}
